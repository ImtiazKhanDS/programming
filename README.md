### programming
#### Basics
1. A computer has mainly three important components
   
   a. storage , namely ram, hardisk etc.
   b. processing device namely cpu
   c. display devices namely monitor

2. IDE : Integrated development editor : vscode, atom,vim etc.
3. The program starts executing from the main function.
4. Execution of a program happens in a sequential manner.
5. assigned variables are stored in ram.
6. Naming Rules of variables

    a. only consists of letters, digits and underscores
    b. first letter : proper letter / under_score
    c. no reserved keywords, no intermittent spaces
    d. casing matters

7. bit is the smallest unit of memory
8. 1 byte is 8 bits
9. Integer value takes 4 bytes memory in ram.
10. implicit type casting is based on the data type defined
11. explicit type casting where we express our will to change the type.
12. American standard code for information interchange (ASCII)
13. precision: 6 digits after decimal, rounded off till 1st 6 digits of decimal.
14. for float , 4 bytes are allocated, double 8 bytes
15. Format specifier is used to specify the datatype of var being printed.
16. Operators are used to do mathematical operations between operands.
17. x+y : + is an operator , x,y are operands.
18. dividend=divisor*quotient + remainder
19. Modulo operator a%b : 17%5=2
20. Rules of evaluating an expression : BODMAS --> precedence rule.
21. If we have operators of equal precedence then we use associativity rules L-> R or R->L
22. post increment > pre increment in precedence.
23. x==y used to check equality.
24. x!=y used to check non equality.
25. Logical operators : and, or not.
26. decision making constructs if , if else.
27. Looping constructs for loop , while loop and do while.
28.
