1. `Arrays` are collection of elements of same type
2. It has contiguos memory allocation.
4. Insertion is O(1)
5. Look up is O(1)
6. short coming of array is static size.
7. To overcome the above problem ,there is something called `dynamic array`.
8. Default size is allocated when you create a array, and when the array gets filled the memory get allocated gets doubled in a new array and that array gets inserted with the values of earlier array. Amortized time complexity of filling is still O(1).
9. In `python` the lists are nothing but dynamic arrays.
10. Passing by value means , a new copy is going to be created 
11. Passing by reference means , an address is passed
12. By default when you pass an array , the base address which is in the name is passed.
